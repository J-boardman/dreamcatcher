### What is Dreamcatcher?
Dreamcatcher is an application that allows a user to interact with an Large Language Model to get insights about the themes and symbolism present in their dreams. Once they have conversed with the AI interpreter about their dreams, they can have the AI tell them a bedtime story of their chosen mood and setting, all based on the themes present within their dream. Currently there are two types of stories available:

- Short story
- Choose your own adventure

Once the story has been created, a story cover image can be generated based on the story. Once the user has given the story a title and image, it can be saved to be shared with the world!

### Why create this? Can't x, y or z LLM already do this?
_TDLR: It's a passion project to showcase my learning of web technologies with no expectations of mainstream appeal._

Dreamcatcher is an idea I've had since I first started interacting with Chat-GPT when it was quite limited in features. With fulltime study and work in the way, I didn't have much time to implement it. As 2023 went on, Open AI continued to release feature after feature, my idea quickly became obselete and already covered by Open AI's offerings. But it still sparked **_joy_** thinking about creating it. So I decided to create it anyways as a portfolio piece to showcase my progress in web development!
